            <p style="font-size:larger;">Ali made his professional debut on October 29, 1960. From that point until the end of 1963, 
               Ali compiled a 19-0 record with 15 knockout victories. The early fights were not without the trials.
               Clay was knocked down by both Sonny Banks and Cooper, but had won due to Copper's severley cut eye. 
               However the fight with Doug Jones on March 13, 1963, was Ali's toughest fight during this stretch.
              The fight between Jones, and Ali was later named "Fight of the Year".</p>

        <p style="font-size:larger;">By late 1963, Ali had become the top contender for Sonny Liston's title. 
          World Heavyweight Champion, The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in Miami Beach. Liston was an intimidating personality, 
          a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob. This fight would go down in history as one of the
          greatest fights in boxing history as this is where Ali won at the age of 22 becoming wolrd heavyweight champion and beating 
          the previous record and earning the title as "The Greatest". Following the win, a triumphant Ali rushed to the edge of the ring and, 
          pointing to the ringside press, and shouted "Eat your words!" He said, "I am the greatest! I shook up the world. I'm the prettiest thing that ever lived".

      <p style="font-size:larger;">Ali had a highly unorthodox boxing style for a heavyweight (210 pounds), epitomized by his catchphrase 
        "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee." Never an overpowering puncher, Ali relied early in his career on his incredible 
        hand speed, superb reflexes and constant movement, dancing and circling opponents for most of the fight,
        holding his hands low and lashing out with a quick, cutting left jab that he threw from unpredictable angles.</p>

      <p style="font-size:larger;">Not long after announcing his retirement, he came back to fight World Boxing
         Council heavyweight titleholder Larry Holmes in hopes of becoming a four-time champion. That bout, 
         which took place on October 2, 1980, was a one-sided disaster that ended in the 10th round after Ali's 
         legendary trainer, Angelo Dundee, threw in the figurative towel.Muhammad Ali's performance against Larry 
         Holmes in their 1980 bout was so bad that fans had the arguable G.O.A.T. written off as someone who 
         couldn't quit while he was ahead. But considering that lackluster showing, as well as the fact he was just
         weeks away from his 40th birthday, Ali performed creditably against Trevor Berbick in their fight, dubbed 
         "Drama in Bahama."
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:larger;">More tellingly, Ali admitted that he felt he was "finished" and that "Father Time [had] caught up" with 
          him. And with that, he finally hung up his gloves, closing the book on an iconic 21-year pro boxing career.</p>
